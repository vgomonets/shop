<strong>Important Note for TinyMCE Users</strong> <br />
<br />
We have found an issue with the widely used TinyMCE Extra (the word processor-like toolbar for MODX Resources) where you cannot load Resources after Upgrading. TinyMCE by splittingred is no longer actively maintained and we recommend choosing one of the other <a href="https:/modx.com/extras/browse/?search=Tinymce" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TinyMCE Extras</a> for 2.5.1+. There is a <a href="https:/github.com/modxcms/TinyMCE/pull/20/files" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one-line patch available</a> if you want to continue using TinyMCE. <br />
<br />
<strong>Important</strong><br />
Nearly all releases contain vital security patches. If you are using a version lower than 2.3.6 you should consider an upgrade to 2.5.1 mandatory. <br />
<br />
<strong>Security is an Ongoing Process</strong><br />
We cannot stress how important it is to run the most current version of MODX. We are always improving security. Upgrade regularly to reduce the chance of your site getting hacked. If you need help upgrading your MODX site, <a href="http://modx.com/support-and-services/maintain/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">let us know</a>. <br />

<br />
<strong>Highlights of Revolution 2.5</strong><br />
MODX Revolution 2.5 continues the tradition of enhancing functionality and performance for MODX Revolution, augmenting security, and fixing a variety of bugs. The excellent new features include the following areas:<br />
<br />
<strong>Preparing for the Future</strong><br />
MODX CMS has alway been forward thinking. We adopted PDO for database access years before others even considered it, and you could power HTML5/CSS3 mobile responsive sites with our first release in 2005, even though those technologies didn’t exist at the time. We continue this tradition with a few things that are here today, and that will be huge soon:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>PHP 7 compatibility (it’s coming soon to a server near you). PHP 7 performs significantly faster than any previous release before it so your sites should be able to handle more visitors and serve them more quickly, keeping them engaged and returning for more.</li>
    <li>Accessibility improvements worked into the core Manager experience including screen reader and keyboard navigation on the Login screen. The work that is going on for the Accessible Manager theme that takes this much further, works in MODX Revolution 2.5, too.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Improved UX</strong><br />
<img src="https://modx.com/assets/i/blogs/ryan/25-mobile-sim-collage.png" border="0" /><br />
Our quest to improve end-user and developer experiences will never be over. To that point, the following areas received attention for 2.5:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>New default content for new installs provides helpful resources and information. Instead of the empty blank page in all previous versions of MODX Revolution, you now get a nice intro page with some important links to assist and orient new users.</li>
    <li>Much more mobile-friendly Manager. As a stepping stone towards a new Manager in the future, this allows you to make edits and access the Manager much more easily than was possible before thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/12776" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> intense efforts of JP Devries</a>.</li>
    <li>Add ability to unpack zip files in the file tree / media manager</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Developer Sugar</strong><br />
Sometimes you need to create custom functionality that available MODX Extras do not address. Often this involves creating a Custom Manager Pages and interfaces inside a Component.<br />
<br />
Previously, this required a dive into the “exciting” world of ExtJS, with which most people have a loathe-hate relationship. Now, views for applications you build into the MODX Manager are much easier to create using plain old HTML/CSS and MODX Tags. A special thanks goes to Romain Tripault and Susan Ottwell for this <a href="http://modxcookbook.com/customize-manager/cmps/cmp-made-easy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">example of the new Custom Manager Pages in 2.5</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Faster Performance</strong><br />
Google loves fast sites, as do your visitors. MODX has always been performant when serving cached pages, now it’s even more so:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>Parser optimizations which improve pre-caching performance. This means visitors will be served more quickly, and Google will give your site a little more respect, which it clearly deserves.</li>
    <li>The new <em>anonymous_sessions</em> setting (enabled by default) can significantly speed up the performance for sites that don’t need to have PHP sessions or logged in users. When this setting is disabled, and a page is fully cached, having sessionless anonymous visitors eliminates the need for a database connection for that visitor on each request. If your site serves even moderate traffic, this can significantly reduce the amount of processor required to operate. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Changes in MODX Revolution 2.5</strong><br />
Previously created sites, currently on Revolution 2.3 or above, should work when upgrading to 2.5, but we do suggest testing on an clone of your site, first. Earlier versions may take a bit of extra effort and code updates if they use non-public APIs or directly access the database.<br />

<br />
<strong>What&#039;s New in Revolution 2.5</strong> <br />
This new release of MODX Revolution includes a number of excellent new features including: <ul class="dis-ul"> <br />
<li>PHP7 compatibility (it&#039;s coming soon to a server near you) </li>
<li>Much more mobile-friendly Manager as a stepping stone towards a new manager in the future. </li>
<li>Custom Manager Pages (the views for applications built into MODX) are now much easier to build using HTML and MODX Tags. Thanks to Romain Tripault and Susan Ottwell for this <a href="http://modxcookbook.com/customize-manager/cmps/cmp-made-easy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">example of the new Custom Manager Pages in 2.5</a>. </li>
<li>Accessibility improvements worked into the core Manager experience including screen reader and keyboard navigation on the Login screen. </li>
<li>Significant improvement to the parser which could potentially improve pre-caching performance by 15%; </li>
<li>New installs get a new look. Instead of the empty blank page in previous versions you now get a nice intro page with some important links so new users can more easily get started.</li> </ul> <br />
<br />
<strong>Contributors on this Release</strong> <br />
Let’s take the time to thank the individual contributors to this release (in no particular order):Jan Peca, Jason Coward, Thomas Jakobi, Ronald Exterkate, Mike Reid, inreti, Zaigham Rana, Jan Tezner, Elizabeth, Romain, argnist, Anton Pastukhoff, Илья Уткин, Gildas NOEL, Ivan Klimchuk, JP DeVries, Kirill, Mark Hamstra, Mat Dave Jones, Nikolay Lanets, Sergey Shlokov, and Vasily Naumkin, along with many other contributors who log &amp; triage issues, review PRs, and commit code.

Highlights are listed below, but check out the <a href="https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.4.0-pl/core/docs/changelog.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">changelog</a> for the play-by-play. <ul class="dis-ul"> <li>Package Dependencies! Developers can now specify dependencies for their MODX Extras. This is a way bigger deal than can be decribed here.

</li>
<li>Some improvements have been made to the accessibility of the Manager UI. We&#039;ve got a ways to go yet, but this version sets the stage better than any previous version. <br />
</li>
<li>Heroic and necessary steps were taken towards making MODX fully <strong>testable</strong>, thanks to @markwillis82. <br />
</li>
<li>Everyone loves performance optimization, and new database indexes in 2.4 deliver the warm fuzzies. <br />
</li>
<li>Better UX, stability, security and overall goodness abound. <br />
</li>
<li>Again, for the full (and rather long) list, read <a href="https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.4.0-pl/core/docs/changelog.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this</a>. </li></ul> <br />
<br />
<strong>Important:</strong> <br />
Revolution 2.3.6 contained a security patch and is considered a mandatory update. Revolution 2.4.0 contains all same patches from 2.3.6, and also closes the same security issue. <br />

This patch release follows two days after the release of Revo 2.3.4 to correct an issue causing problems with sorting the Resource tree via drag and drop. We also squeezed in a couple more fixes. Why wouldn&#039;t we? I missed posting on the day of release of 2.3.4 and held off until 2.3.5 was released to publish the announcement so here&#039;s a combined announcement that includes details of both patch releases. Most of the major improvements were in the 2.3.4 release. Read on to find out more. <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the list of changes in Revo 2.3.5: <br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><li>Fix drag and drop Resource sort when auto_isfolder setting is enabled </li>
<li>Fix Account drop down hover on small screens </li>
<li>Compile Sass with libsass </li>
<li>Update npm packages </li>
<li>Update and Relax bower packages View the <a href="https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.3.5-pl/core/docs/changelog.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">changelog</a>. </li></ul>

<br />
Revolution 2.3.4 included two dozen fixes, many of which are bugfixes and refinements to the Manager. Here are the highlights:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><li>Fixes to custom manager themes </li>
<li>Fix editing Amazon S3 Media sources </li>
<li>Quick update form, now displays the Resource pagetitle or Element name rather than just &quot;Quick Update&quot;. </li>
<li>Update Font Awesome to 4.3.0 </li>
<li>Update bower package for correctly building Manager themes </li>
<li>Correctly apply Resource locks to current user </li>

This patch release follows two days after the release of Revo 2.3.4 to correct an issue causing problems with sorting the Resource tree via drag and drop. We also squeezed in a couple more fixes. Why wouldn&#039;t we? I missed posting on the day of release of 2.3.4 and held off until 2.3.5 was released to publish the announcement so here&#039;s a combined announcement that includes details of both patch releases. Most of the major improvements were in the 2.3.4 release. Read on to find out more. <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the list of changes in Revo 2.3.5: <br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><li>Fix drag and drop Resource sort when auto_isfolder setting is enabled </li>
<li>Fix Account drop down hover on small screens </li>
<li>Compile Sass with libsass </li>

The previous official MODXpo was hosted in <a href="http://2013.modxpo.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">November 2013 in Cologne, Germany</a>. After a year hiatus (though not without an awesome MODX conference in between), web designer and MODX Ambassador, <a href="http://www.bdcreative-design.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Benjamin Davis</a>, has taken the reins as chief organizer for the next official MODXpo with major help from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/MODX-Muenchen/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Munich Meetup Group</a> and other <a href="http://modx.com/ambassadors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Ambassadors</a>. <br />

MODXpo is an international conference for people who build websites with, and use MODX. Sessions include presentations and workshops for both a beginner and seasoned pro. Everyone who attends a MODXpo comes away filled with new perspectives for solving business or clients&#039; problems. There&#039;s nothing like it. <br />
<br />
<strong>Host Sponsors Kochan &amp; Partner</strong><br />
The catalyst for MODXpo 2015 was the Munich-based agency, and MODX fans, Kochan &amp; Partner. They graciously offered to host the event in their 200 person capacity hall. <a href="http://www.kochan.de/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kochan &amp; Partner</a> have been long-time MODX users and host the local MODX meetups in Munich. <br />
<br />
<strong>Ideas and Voices</strong><br />
No conference would be complete without interesting topics and speakers. The organizers would like as much input as possible for shaping MODXpo 2015 into the best conference it can be. The organizing team is seeking your ideas on interesting talks and are looking for proposals from anyone in the MODX community who is interested in sharing some of how they work. <a href="https:/docs.google.com/forms/d/1TZXJ3upiYEjCzBvq0uPM4VPaNvCI7NtEGqFEk0qQ2nM/viewform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Submit your topic ideas</a>. <br />

Even if you&#039;ve never spoken at an event before but have solved some problems in an interesting way for your business, your clients or just built something cool. That&#039;s all you need to start building your talk. <a href="https:/docs.google.com/forms/d/1dJDaWm9hTLfkyrkpLjlAiLqB09eWUcwbgJdHOQdcBPo/viewform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apply to speak at MODXpo 2015.</a> <br />
<br />
<strong>Call for Sponsors</strong><br />
Of course an event of this size cannot rely only on a single host sponsor, as nice as the team at Kochan &amp; Partner are. We&#039;d like to partner with some awesome organizations who are looking to support the MODX event or put their brand in front of the MODX community at large. <a href="http://2015.modxpo.eu/#contact-form" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contact the MODXpo 2015 team</a> to ask about becoming a sponsor partner <br />

<br />
As you know, MODX has always stood for creative freedom. However, Revo’s Manager has failed to deliver that promise for all. People who use assistive technologies like screen readers, enlarged fonts and alternate input devices were never really given proper consideration. That must change. <br />
<br />
We want to make it right by making it possible for anyone to use MODX, no matter what. <br />

<strong>A Huge Head Start</strong><br />
We have already started research and development work on this important initiative thanks to $25,000 in funding from <a href="http://www.osu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Ohio State University</a>. We’re looking to complete the effort by crowdfunding a matching amount. If only 1000 MODX community members and their clients donated $25, we’d reach our goal, virtually overnight. You can <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/a11y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">get directly involved</a>, too.<br />
 <br />
All funds raised will be used to dedicate development resources, expert consulting and user testing. <br />
 <br />
<strong>You Can Make a Difference</strong><br />
So please help us reach our goal so we can bring MODX to everyone. Take a minute (right now please!) to visit <a href="http://a11y.modx.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a11y.modx.com</a> and find the donation level that’s right for you. Any amount will make a difference, and it’s easy to support this very worthy cause. All donations over $25 are eligible for a variety of donor rewards including MODX stickers, shirts and hats exclusive to this campaign, and some really awesome Accessibility courses from <a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deque University</a>. <br />

<strong>Help Spread the Word</strong><br />
If you can’t support this initiative personally, but work with MODX professionally, we’d love to see your company or customers supporting the accessible MODX Manager project, too. It takes just a few seconds to forward this message along with a simple request from you.<br />
